      <h1>Tayyaba's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Tayyaba. I am a undergraduate student at Cornell University, Class of 2022. I am majoring in Computer Science and Asian Studies.
          A lot of people ask my why I chose these two majors since they appear to be very different. Truthfully, I enjoy STEM and Humanities a lot and believe that
          they are equally as important. In Asian Studies, I mostly focus on Japan and South Asia and am currently studying Japanese. I was supposed to study abroad in 
          Japan, Fall 2020, but due to recent events that has been postponed to Spring 2021, fingers crossed!</p>

      <p>A little more about me is that I really enjoy expressing my creative side in many ways, from graphic deisgn to trying out new makeup looks! I am also a big animal lover,
             growing up I always wanted a cat, but after my parents' constant refusal I ended up getting guinea pigs. I have three guinea pigs right now (at one point I had five), 
             and they are the sweetest.
             I used to read a lot when I was younger so that is something that I am trying to get back into, always looking for reccomendations so if you have, please any let me know!</p>

      <p> Professional Information: Most of the projects I have made have been in class, like a spotify playlist creator, an adaptation of the classic arcade game, Alien Invaders, 
          a maze solving game, and some Turtle programming. Not to mention this portfolio too! Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tayyabaali/">LinkedIn</a> and
